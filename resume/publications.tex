        \item Derived a novel hyperbolic formulation of General Relativity using a reference metric approach
        \item Achieved performance equivalent or exceeding leading formulations of General Relativity such as GBSSN and FCCZ4
        \item Demonstrated the stability of the formulation through a pseudodifferential first order reduction and simulations in the strong field regime
        % \item Demonstrated that it is possible to achieve performance equivalent to GBSSN and Fully Covariant and Conformal Z4 (FCCZ4) through a modification of Z4 wherein constraint violations are coupled to a reference metric
