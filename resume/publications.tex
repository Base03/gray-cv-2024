    {\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item Derives a novel formulation of the Z4 system of General Relativity using a reference metric approach and demonstrates its stability through a pseudodifferential first order reduction
        % \item Demonstrated that it is possible to achieve performance equivalent to GBSSN and Fully Covariant and Conformal Z4 (FCCZ4) through a modification of Z4 wherein constraint violations are coupled to a reference metric
        % \item The formulation was demonstrated to be strongly hyperbolic via a pseudodifferential first order reduction and simulations in the strong field regime
