    {\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve performance equivalent to GBSSN and Fully Covariant and Conformal Z4 (FCCZ4) through a modification of Z4 wherein constraint violations are coupled to a reference metric
        \item The formulation is demonstrated to be strongly hyperbolic via a pseudodifferential first order reduction and simulations in the strong field regime

    {\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item We investigate the stability of nonminimally coupled topological-defect boson stars with particular focus on the unusual shell-like solutions of a previous investigation
